    Networks, Software Security, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, 
    Big Data / Distributed Systems, Programming Language Design.

<br>

### Experience
---
**Back-end Software Engineer** (Feb. 2024 - Present) \
*Capital One | Big Data Streaming Platform | Atlanta, GA*

- Developed a feature to transform and publish customer data as a
    standardized format for internal use. Used Java Spring to code
    the logic, and dealt with challenges to ensure program could
    execute concurrently.

- Implemented unit tests, component tests, and live dependency
    tests for 2 microservices to ensure their reliability. Used
    JUnit and Cucumber to write the tests, and solved challenges
    with the object oriented design of the tests.

- Programmed distributed tracing and metrics for 2 microservices
    to catch bugs using Open Telemetry and Micrometer. Dealt with
    challenges related to integrating a custom tracer on an Apache
    Flink micro-service.

**Software Engineer Intern** (June 2023 - Aug. 2023) \
*Capital One | Dataset Dashboard and File Summary Application | McLean, VA*
